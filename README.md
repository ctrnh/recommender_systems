Recommender system. (still working on it, this is a first MVP)

# Requirements

- Python3
- numpy
- pandas
- surprise


# Jokey
A jokes recommender based on collaborative filtering and sequential learning (bandits) algorithms, trained on Jester Dataset

## How to run
```
git clone 
cd recommender_systems/jokey
python jokey.py
```



# Coming soon...

## Will do
- Scale using Spark
- Deep learning recommenders
- Other well-known CF algo
- Create structure for benchmarking + metrics


## Nice to have
- Better user interface (website?)
- Knowledgeable users can choose parameters
- Users can rate the recommender
- Test multiple recommenders on users, collect data
- could create content based recommender using nlp. Pb is  should find an unsupervised method since don't have labels. (Data mining on web to find jokes in internet and therefore labellise? look at deep content analytics? )
